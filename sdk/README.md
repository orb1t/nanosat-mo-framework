# NanoSat MO Framework SDK
The SDK contains a set of tools and example projects in order to facilitate quicker development of applications by the framework users.

The SDK depends on the NMF Mission - Software Simulator.

## SDK content

### Tools
- [Consumer Test Tool](tools/consumer-test-tool) - allows consuming all of the services exposed by NMF through an user-friendly GUI
- [Package Assembler](tools/package-assembler) - allows packaging space apps into a deliverables to mission

### [Space Examples](examples/space)
Various space applications demonstrating the uses of the on-board framework.

### [Ground Examples](examples/ground)
Various ground applications demonstrating the uses of the ground framework.

### [Documentation](sdk-package/resources/docs)
Various supporting documents, including:
- Space Apps Development Guide
- Ground Apps Development Guide
- Software Requirements Document
- Software Design Document
- Relevant CCSDS standards
- CCSDS MO Services Interface Control Documents (MO ICDs)
- Javadocs (only in the SDK Release Package) - aggregated javadocs of the CCSDS MO Framework and the NanoSat MO Framework

### SDK Release package
The release packages contain binaries of the tools, most relevant examples, mission simulator GUI, and documentation.

## Building a release package

Instructions:
1. Update the MO ICDs if there were changes in the NMF MO XML files
2. Invoke `mvn clean install` target on the main POM file
3. The packaged SDK can be found under `sdk-package/target`

Tips:
- Full build takes some time.
Afterwards it is possible to rebuild particular sub-projects individually,
or to use `mvn install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Desa.nmf.sdk.assembly.quickbuild=true` to speed up the intermediate build process.

## Running the SDK
Start the NMF Supervisor from the assembled SDK package, e.g.:
`$ nmf-sdk-2.0.0/bin/space/nanosat-mo-supervisor-sim/nanosat-mo-supervisor-sim.sh`

Start the Consumer Test tool, e.g.:
`$ nmf-sdk-2.0.0/bin/tools/consumer-test-tool/consumer-test-tool.sh`

Connect the CTT to the Supervisor by using the Directory Service MAL URI generated by the Supervisor, printed both in the console and providerURIs.properties file. e.g:
`INFO: URI: maltcp://123.123.123.123:1024/nanosat-mo-supervisor-Directory`

## Running/Debugging the applications from the IDE
Recommended IDE is Netbeans

### Supervisor
Set the working directory of the project to the directory of the Supervisor inside the SDK package:

> In Netbeans, Right Click on a project (e.g. 'ESA NMF Mission Simulator - NanoSat MO Supervisor')->Properties->Run, and set the Working Directory value to
> `nmf-sdk-2.0.0/bin/space/nanosat-mo-supervisor-sim/`

### CTT
Set the working directory of the CTT project to the working directory of the CTT inside the SDK package (`nmf-sdk-2.0.0/bin/tools/consumer-test-tool`)

### Apps
Set the working directory of the application to the working directory of any space app inside the SDK.

Specify the URI of a running Supervisor's Directory Service, so the app can connect to it and consume Platform Services provided by the Supervisor:
> In Netbeans, Right Click on a project (e.g. 'ESA NMF SDK App Example - All MC services')->Properties->Run, and set the VM Options to:
> `-Desa.mo.nmf.centralDirectoryURI=<Directory_Service_URI>`
> e.g.
> `-Desa.mo.nmf.centralDirectoryURI=maltcp://123.123.123.123:1024/nanosat-mo-supervisor-Directory`
